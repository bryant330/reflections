What happens when you initialize a repository?Why do you need to do it?

there is a hidden .git in that file that i initialised. The git file will store
the metadata of the repository which allow me to keep track of my files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The value that staging area offers is that it provide a buffer place for programmers
to commit their changes.
