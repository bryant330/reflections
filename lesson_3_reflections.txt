How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
Collaborate without Git or Github will be harder because the developers will easily lose track on the progress of the project.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	
When I’m experimenting something that might break the main codes I will definitely do it in a separate branch. If anything happen to the branch, I can go back and work on the master.
